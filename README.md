# Data-Structures
Going over data structures for a quick study guide

## Single linked list
```
A single linked list is compsed of two part:
- node
- pointer
-- The pointer points to another node in the list or points to null at the end of the list
```

### Advantages over arrays 
-Dynamic in size
-Ease of insertion/deletion

### Drawbacks 
- We need to access the list starting at the first node(also none as the head) and iterate through to reach the end. 
- Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
